As far as privacy is concerned, I don't do any tracking, not even Google Analytics. My policy is that I respect both my own privacy and the privacy of others and I don't intend to monetise it in any way - no advertising, no selling your data, no tracking who visits my site. Yes, HTTP requests are logged, like everywhere, but apart from the IP address and the resource served, little comes from them.

That's about it for now. The service is evolving, if I add logging, comments or any paid features then I'll have to collect a bit more information, but I'll let you know then. And I don't intend to change my approach to privacy - no trading.
