It has a large catalog of objects, both in our Solar System (Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, spaceships) and outside it (brown dwarfs, stars, nebulae, galaxies...). Everything in motion, which allows you to observe, for example, eclipses or the dance of stars in multiple systems. Celestial bodies can have different textures assigned - with different resolutions, but also presenting, for example, the surface in different geological periods.

Celestia creates very nice views. See for yourself:

Personally, I like to revel in them ;) but the coolest thing for me is the possibility of customization. There are whole gigabytes of add-ons available, which add celestial bodies, better textures, additional spaceships, etc. And not only real ones - there is a whole catalog of fictional objects, also from well-known universes such as Babylon 5 or Star Wars. Adding them is very easy - just unpack the add-on in the `extras` directory and restart the program. For those who want to have everything at hand, without the tedious downloading of individual add-ons, there is the [Celestia Origins] project (https://vk.com/celestiaorigin). Those who are annoyed by the home page in the orc language can look for announcements about the next releases on [Celestia Forums] (https://celestiaproject.space/forum/viewforum.php?f=23).
