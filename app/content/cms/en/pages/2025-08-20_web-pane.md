  Hooray! The first version of the web-pane desktop app is ready!

  So, what is web-pane this time? It’s a nifty little desktop tool that lets you open floating utility windows—always on top of everything else. Each window can hold several websites, and you can switch between them as needed.

The need for this app came up a bit… accidentally. My screen started feeling cramped. I had my code editor open, plus a terminal, ChatGPT in the browser, image generators, documentation pages—you get the idea. I solved the terminal clutter with Guake—a nice drop-down terminal that slides in and out when needed.

But having a “reference” window that floats above everything else? That was trickier.
Sure, in Linux Mint Cinnamon, you can turn websites into minimal web apps in small windows (with just a browser shell), and there are multiple ways to do that. But every time, you have to manually set them to “always on top.” You can pin them to the panel or dock, but that clutters the panel and window list—and docks don’t always update correctly.

So I tried a few brilliant ChatGPT-suggested hacks to glue the whole setup together... until I gave up and decided to build something myself.

Since I know and like Node.js and TypeScript, I went with a custom app using Electron
.
Electron lets you build cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript—running on Windows, Linux, and macOS. I hadn’t used it before, so I asked ChatGPT for help. (Honestly, I should probably write a separate blog post about using AI for coding.)

Anyway, GPT gave me some minimal code that technically worked… just not how I wanted. And the moment you look at a messy, tangled prototype at version 0.1, you just know that adding features will only make it worse.

So I rewrote the whole thing from scratch. Gave it some structure, started testing, added functionality. Turns out, due to some Electron limitations, not everything is possible (like fully integrating with docks or flagging which apps are running). And some things had to be done differently (still no idea why Electron mangles the arguments it passes to the main instance). But—I got it working.

Current features:
- Launch multiple web pages inside one of two persistent windows—either from the command line or a trigger.
- Switch between pages using the command line, dock triggers, or keyboard shortcuts.
- Windows are always on top, but you can minimize them—again, via command line, triggers, or hotkeys.
- Interact with the loaded web pages: reload, close, navigate forward/back, zoom in/out—all via keyboard shortcuts.
- Windows can be repositioned, and the app remembers their locations.
- The app is multilingual.

And that's it for version one! Still plenty of room to grow, but now I can actually breathe on my desktop.
