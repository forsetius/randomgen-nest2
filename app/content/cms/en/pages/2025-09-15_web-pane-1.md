  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is... **`web-pane` 1.0**!
  
  After just under four additional weeks I shipped version 1.0 and consider the app ready. At least on Linux.

What has changed since the previous version? Several important features appeared, a few smoothing tweaks landed, and plenty of invisible improvements tightened up the code. Let's take a look:

### Installation packages

Previously the app could only be used if you installed Node.js, pulled the code from the repository, built the project, and launched it manually. Great for development, not so suitable for regular users. I have now added an improvement that builds installation packages automatically as soon as the code lands in the repository. Packages—plural—because they ship for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Specifically, these are:
- **Linux DEB** - a system package for Debian, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint
- **Linux AppImage** - a self-contained app you run per user without administrator privileges
- **Windows Installer** - the standard Windows installer (NSIS) that installs the app system-wide
- **Windows Portable** - a no-install executable that runs on its own
- **macOS Zip** - a regular zipped bundle for macOS. Unfortunately, I neither own a Mac nor wish to spend $100/year on a certificate, so there will be no signed installer

### Preferences

There's now a preferences window where you can decide whether the app windows should have:
- a title bar with buttons (minimize, restore, and close) or whether they should show only the desired page (which looks great)
- a menu bar — visible only when the title bar is present, but still optional
- an icon on the app list/dock — you can hide it so it doesn't take up space

If you disable everything, the app can only be controlled with keyboard shortcuts, but I doubt that scares power users :) And I have to say, a clean ChatGPT floating above the desktop looks majestic ;)

### View switcher

That same window lets you open multiple pages or web apps. Until now, switching between them required clicking the activator (a shortcut or dock item) or issuing a command from the terminal. Now you just press `Control+Tab` or `Control+Shift+Tab` to move forward or backward through the list of open views. Even better, a switcher pops up with icons for each page—just like the system's `Alt+Tab` window switcher.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The entire app can be operated with keyboard shortcuts. They let you:
- minimize windows; to restore minimized windows you need to configure a global shortcut
- close a view, a window, or the entire application
- reload the page view (including a hard reload that bypasses the cache)
- increase, decrease, or reset the page zoom level
- navigate backward and forward in the browsing history
- switch between page views
- open the preferences window

You can also move and resize the windows.

### More windows

The previous version shipped with just two windows: left and right. Now you can open however many you want — no fixed names, no limits. You can make them tiny and scatter them across the screen like fridge magnets. That might not be ideal for reading documentation, but it's perfect for translating short phrases in an online translator.

### Under the hood

There are meaningful but invisible changes in the code as well. I won't list them all here — check the updated [`web-pane` technical page]{en/web-pane} for details.

## Summary

Right now the app fully serves the purpose I designed it for: a set of minimalist windows hovering above everything else, keeping reference text or web tools in view while you work in other apps. Window positions and sizes are remembered, and thanks to dock integration (or other shortcut launchers) you can open the desired pages with a single click. You can load a set of pages into one window and switch between them as needed. The app can be controlled from the keyboard or from the main menu. When necessary, it can stay completely hidden and be summoned with a global shortcut.

**Enjoy!**
