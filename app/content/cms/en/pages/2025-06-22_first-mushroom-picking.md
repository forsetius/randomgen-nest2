We set off at the pale, barbaric dawn, i.e. at 7 a.m., and arrived at our destination before 9 a.m. The heat was already palpable in the air, but there it was still quite fresh in the shade. I was so enchanted by this freshness that I sprawled out with a blanket among the grass and reveled in its scent and the chirping of birds. Specifically, according to [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) 15 species of birds.

Then we went further, immersing ourselves in the beautiful natural surroundings of the forest. It was a bit wilder than we remembered from autumn, because the paths had not yet been trodden by the boots of the throngs of mushroom pickers.

While I left the forest empty-handed, Ajsa found the **first MUSHROOM of the season!** Okay, it was quite small, so "**mushroom**".

She wouldn't have found that mushroom if it weren't for the overwhelming feeling of terror that had taken hold of her. The atavistic fear of a victim when she felt the gaze of a predator on her. A gaze that was so filled with hatred, it seemed capable of stabbing a dagger in the back! She looked around, wondering what kind of animal could it be: a wolf, a boar, a wild dog? No, so she scans lower: a fox, maybe a hare? No. Suddenly, she heard a hoarse scream from above, the likes of which she had never heard in her life! She raised her eyes... and there was a squirrel! And that was no joke, because it was armed to the teeth... with a pine cone! It fixed her evil eyes on Ajsa and screamed again!

The squirrel screamed, not Ajsa. Ajsa retaliated with an icy look, spun around with dignity... and there was a **mushroom**!
