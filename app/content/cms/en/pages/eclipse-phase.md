**Eclipse Phase** is an [RPG system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) set approximately 120 years in the future, after the destruction of Earth caused by the rebellion of [TITANs](#) - military artificial intelligences*. It is described as a post-apocalyptic conspiracy and horror game, touching on issues of [transhumanism](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanizm), the clash of various political and economic ideologies, and survival in the face of threats to the existence of the human race. So we have the constant threat of TITAN weapons, monstrous products of biological, digital, and memetic infections, but also threats that people create for themselves. We have conspiracies that fight these terrifying threats... and each other. There are cyberpunk hypercorporations and societies, but also alliances of nomads and anarchists of various stripes at odds with them.

This is [hard science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction): there are no faster-than-light ships, lasers whistling in a vacuum, aliens differing from Earthlings only in their heads, and similar elements of space fairy tales confusingly called SF. There are indeed psionic powers, but it is more of a disease than the Force from Star Wars. There are Pandorian Gates, but they are far from Star Gates and are a deadly threat in themselves.

There is: the emptiness of the Solar System and the habitats of transhumans rescued from the Fall scattered throughout it. **Trans**humans, H+, people enhanced biologically, cybernetically, and nanotechnologically, but not necessarily mentally. They still strive for recognition and fame, fight for resources, ideas, and power, and they are different - more different than ever before in History. For when even the body becomes a replaceable tool, a mere sleeve for consciousness, which is also enhanced with biological enhancements, cyber-implants, nano-sockets, etc., transhumans begin to differ from each other in both morphology and material status. After all, while the rich change bodies like gloves, others have to settle for cheap junk or are completely deprived of their bodies.

And as they fight among themselves in this little solar system, they don't know if another catastrophe is approaching. One that will end the History of _Homo Sapiens sapiens_ forever.
